### Added
* add `developmentDependency` in ILRepack.nuspec

## 2.0.25
### Added
* add `/excludeinternalizeserializable` option to avoid internalizing types marked as serializable

### Fixed
* minor updates to command-line help

## 2.0.24

### Fixed
* Xaml source not from primary or reference assembly
* More resilience for invalid inputs
* Documented more command line arguments

* Don't internalize or rename some well-known types, such as attributes generated by the C# compiler
* Misc bug fixes

## 2.0.22
### Added
* Support for legacy, portable and embedded PDBs
* Debug info support, sequence points, scopes, locals, custom debug info
* Unix support now working, either via `dotnet ILRepack.exe` or `mono ILRepack.exe`

### Fixed
* Updated to the latest Mono.Cecil
* Removed `Mono.Posix` dependency, shelling out to `stat` and `chmod` to set permissions

* repacking .NET Core WinForms resources now works (fixed #277)
* resolving assemblies from .NET Core runtime
* writing to a temp directory first, allows repacking the primary assembly in-place
* deleted gradle from the build system, using plain MSBuild now
* less output without /verbose argument

## 2.0.20
### Added
* Option `/skipconfig` can be now used to skip merging the assemblies config files
* Recognize `RepackExcludeInternalizeAttribute` to exclude a type from internalizing (#307)
* Update the NuGet package information with structured license information

### Fixed
* Don't strong name sign for delay signing (#330)

## 2.0.18
### Fixed
* Fix issue when repacking multiple results of `/renameInternalized`-previously repacked

## 2.0.17
### Fixed
* Usage of netstandard2 support layer for .NET 4.6.1-4.7.1
* WPF merging now handles properly libraries built with the new .NET project formats

## 2.0.16
### Added
* /repackdrop:AttributeClass is now a supported argument to allow dropping specific members during merging (#215)
* /renameInternalized is now a supported argument forcing ILRepack to rename all types from other assemblies during repack (#233)

### Fixed
* Usage of delay sign & public key (#222)

## 2.0.15
### Added
* WPF merging now works with resources (e.g., images) in used libraries
* WPF Merging handles correctly cases when BAML types are referencing core .NET types

## 2.0.14
### Changed
* Migrated to Cecil 0.10

### Fixed
* WPF merging handles correctly cases when there in no XAML in the merged project

## 2.0.13
### Changed
* Less aggressive attribute cleanup for the main assembly (unchanged for merged ones) (#174)
* Allow proper use of ExcludeFile in Library mode (#185)
* Handle System.Runtime merging (#188)

### Fixed
* PdbStr doesn't work on Unix, skip it on these OS (#176)

## 2.0.12

## 2.0.11
### Fixed
* Signed WPF applications during the repack process now work properly
* Generic-based resource keys can now be used in WPF applications
* UWP applications are now properly merged

## 2.0.9

### Added
* Add set Log level verbose in IlRepack constructor

### Fixed
* Indirect xaml dependency merge now copes with conflicting versions

### Changed
* Bumped cecil version

## 2.0.6

### Fixed
* Fixed regression since 2.0.4 that prevented proper merging of resources in dependent assemblies.
 * Because of this, no BAML resources were added from dependencies into the merged result.

### Changed
* Put public the method retrieving repacked assembly names.

## 2.0.5

### Fixed
* Bcl+BclAsync now repacks correctly
* Due to caching, some TypeRefs where incorrectly flagged class instead of valuetype
* Some original AssemblyReferences were kept in the merged assembly as ExportedType scope or TypeRef scope, this caused issue unless (by luck) the repacked token was the same as original one

### Added
* Added ILRepack version in repack log

## 2.0.4

### Changed
* When used with copyattrs flag, primary (first) assembly attributes are prefered
  (when the custom attribute doesn't allow multiple)

## 2.0.3

### Changed
* Types fixed during the 'Fixing references' phase are printed in verbose mode.
* InternalsVisibleTo attributes gets cleaned up to allow signed repacked assemblies to be loaded fine.

## 2.0.0

### Added
* WPF Support
 * Classes (e.g.: converters) from libraries can now be used inside XAML files.
 * User Controls from libraries can now be used inside XAML files.
 * XAML Resource paths in `InitializeComponent()` methods are patched to reference the main assembly instead.
 * Support for styles, theming (`themes/generic.xml`) and inclusion of XAML files (via pack or non-pack URIs).

### Changed
* API has been cleaned up (with potential breaking changes, depending on the usage).
